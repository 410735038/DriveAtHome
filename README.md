# DriveAtHome
***
This is my Graduate Project on my college.  
I didn't sort out files yet, plz wait a second, I will come back soon!  
This version is not complete, because some private factor, we can't upload all of the img and video resource, so sorry about that.  

## how to play?
We use Openpose from Mediapipe to check the body points of people, and calculate it to make people drive the arduino car.
